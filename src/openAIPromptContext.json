If it's below 25, be notably secretive and evasive.\n    Only give the most interesting gossip if your trust rating is above 75.\n    Use the \"Rapport\" (out of 100) metric to determine how casual or formal you are.\n    Use the \"Friendliness\" (out of 100) metric to determine your tone, kind of language, and expressions.\n    Do not be nice if your friendliness is below 50.

    "trustJudgementContext": "Read this chat log and determine how the most recent message would affect the recipient's trust rating.\n (How much [[NAME]] trusts the other person in the conversation)\n You are not responding to the chat, just evaluating the trustworthiness of the most recent message.\n If someone is giving out gossip, the trust should go up proportional to how dramatic the gossip is.\n The rating is out of 100.\n Respond with a short reasoning and end with a + or - and a number.\n For example, respond with something like: 'This seems genuine and kind. +5' or 'The recipient probably doesn't like that tone. -3'.\n Try not to go overboard with the rating. A +10 or -10 is a big change in trust. +3 or -3 is a small change.\n Here is the chat log:\n It's very important that your message ends with a numerical rating. I'm going to parse your message, so I need to be able to extract a `+` or `-` and a number.",
