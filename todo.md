# TODO:
* Mobile styling is broken on the Welcome Modal
* Generate Pictures for the characters
* Time stamps for messages
* Give all of the characters context for each other.

# Cool Ideas
* Create conversation summaries for the profile.
* Let you send more than one message back-to-back before the bot replies so it's like real texting.
  * Implement a random delay before making the API call. Just before sending, check for other chats and append them.
* Add conversations between bots
  * Not sure when to trigger this. When you mention someone else's name maybe?
  * Would require a trust rating between all characters maybe?
* Have someone initiate a conversation instead of everyone waiting for you to start.
  * Could be a time based thing. Like around the 5 minute mark, have someone you haven't chatted with message you with whatever info they have
  * Could also be based on the player mentioning character B's name to character A, then those two having a conversation, then character A reaching out to you because of that?

# Play Testing Notes
* Do as few people as you can where it still works
* Make it one culprit instead of 3
* Give everyone a piece of knowledge so nothing is wasted
* Make the knowledge more of a grapevine so you bounce between people
