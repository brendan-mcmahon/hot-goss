# TODO:
* Style for mobile
* Deploy this somewhere
* Generate Pictures for the characters
* Time stamps for messages

# Cool Ideas
* Create conversation summaries for the profile.
* Give all of the characters context for each other.
* Implement a random delay before making the API call. Just before sending, check for other chats and append them.
* Add a dynamic "list of events and information" to prepend to each API call so that we can add conversations between bots
